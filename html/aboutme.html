    <h4>About Me</h4>

    <p>I am an active individual who enjoys music, fashion, and the outdoors. 
        Professionally, I believe numbers tell stories and am passionate about putting data to work 
        to enhance the human experience. As a student of statistics, 
        I work diligently to build the skills necessary to properly gather and analyze data to answer 
        hard-hitting questions and solve problems in any industry. I practice creating polished reports 
        to make my findings concise and easy to understand. As a board member for one of the most dedicated 
        student sections in the country, I implement my analytical thinking and refined communication to 
        increase attendance, revenue, and engagement.</p>
